## Goal
Many tech companies have been incentivizing job seekers with staggering salaries to encourage more people to join the industry. But since the new coronavirus ravaged the world in 2020, the global economy has begun to fluctuate wildly, and the labor market has also received a considerable impact. To snatch high- end technical talents, many companies offer salaries beyond the salary range of fresh graduates to attract talents, which leads to very unhealthy and vicious competition. Therefore, the project hopes to analyze salary data and make reasonable predictions, to help major companies effectively control their labor costs and attract talents.

## Data
The raw data for this project comes from Stack Overflow's annual developer survey. Most respondents work in data-related jobs (data scientists, machine learning specialists, database administrators, business analysts, data engineers, etc.). The respondents' resources fill in the data. Judging from the final dataset compiled from all the questionnaires collected at the end, it has 15 variables and 33.6k results.

## Analytics Tools
Python, regression models
